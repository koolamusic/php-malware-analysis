# SEO tool related to nptzow

A fairly intrusive redirector.
It injects PHP code in every theme-related file named `header.php`.
If the injected code decides, based on User Agent string,
that an invoker is a "bot",
it uses `curl` to retrieve material from a host `zalroews.pw`
and returns whatever that material may be.

Apparently if it decides you aren't a "bot",
you get to see the compromised blog,
assuming it still works after its theme's `header.php` files have been futzed with.

Code is related to that of [nptzow](https://github.com/bediger4000/php-malware-analysis/tree/master/nptzow),
but is vastly simplified.
It does not try to fill in HTML templates with material it retrieves from a ".pw" TLD host,
it just returns material from that host.

## Origin

### Download

Downloaded to URI `/blog/wp-content/plugins/wp_bing/wp-ajax.php`,
with 'a', 'c' and 'p1' HTTP parameters, indicating the attacker(s)
thought that `wp-ajax.php` was a WSO web shell.
The 'a' parameter had the value 'Php', which constitutes immediate
eval of PHP source code.
'p1' parameter's value was the PHP source code.

The HTTP request also contained a parameter named "pass", with a value "root".
That would authenticate the request to a real WSO that had that password.

The IP address of the attacker accessed my web site and WordPress honey pot
about 50 times since 2018-06-25,
always invoking the URI `/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/revslider/temp/update_extract/revslider/db.php`,
except for 9 times, where it asked for some semi-gibberish URIs:

The semi-gibberish has a biological or maybe paleontological flavor to it.

The IP address always uses a User Agent string of `Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/48.
0.2564.109 Safari/537.36`.
This is the same User Agent string that the downloaders of [nptzow](https://github.com/bediger4000/php-malware-analysis/tree/master/nptzow) used.

## Deobfuscation

The PHP source code that a WSO web shell would eval comprised a "dropper".
The dropper would create a file named `180912692c2.php` at the 
Apache DocumentRoot directory, if it could.
The dropper would base64 decode a string in the the PHP source code
to obtain the file's contents.
The dropper would change `180912692c2.php` access and modification time
to somewhere between 10 and 70 days in the past.
The attacker's might believe this camoflages the file a little.

## Analysis

I pretty-printed [180912692c2.php](180912692c2.php) for ease of reading.

After "downloading" the file `180912692c2.php`,
45.227.252.251 tried to [invoke it via HTTP](45.227.252.251W3jm6CcueuD2kXLupgvzcwAAAAI.mailer.scans.scans).
My WordPress honey pot code intercepted that request and answered with a 404 "file not found" status code.
A "test_url" HTTP parameter got sent, which should have caused `180912692c2.php` to give back a string "file test okay".
Feedback to the invokers.

Upon successful invocation,  `180912692c2.php` would look through all the directories `wp-content/themes/*/`
for files named `header.php`. If a file named `header.php` existed,
and did not have the string "zalroews.pw" in it
(checked using obsolete PHP function `eregi()`, which doesn't work on PHP 7.x by default),
`180912692c2.php` tries to write a string from its source code into the `header.php` file.
The code in `180912692c2.php` ends up deleting its source file.
Only the code written into `header.php` files would remain.

The code written in [header.php](https://github.com/bediger4000/php-malware-analysis/blob/master//45.227.252.251-2018-08-19a/header.php)
files shares a lot with the code in nptzow's
[flvoaw.php](https://github.com/bediger4000/php-malware-analysis/blob/master/nptzow/nptzow/flvoaw.php).

Between `header.php` code and `flvoaw.php`,
variable names are identical, as is the list of regular expressions used to
decide if an invoker is a "bot" or not is the same.
`header.php` does not have the HTML template filling or
caching of the HTML that `flvoaw.php` has.

`header.php` code just passes control to the theme's PHP code,
where `flvoaw.php` would redirect browsers:

    header("Location: http://caforyn.pw/for/77?d=$d&mykeys=$mykeys");

It looks like `flvoaw.php` had some mechanism for putting keywords
into the searches made to fill in HTML templates for bot's consumption.

`header.php` code sends the user agent string of the request to
zalroews.pw for material to send to a "bot".
I guess this would allow zalroews.pw code to tailor what it
sends to each bot.

When researching `flvoaw.php`, I found out about "vlomaw".
vlomaw appears more elaborate than nptzow or nowir `flvoaw.php`,
which appears more elaborate than the `header.php` code.
This may constitute a case of malware evolving towards simplicity,
where it usually just gets more elaborate,
often by wholesale code borrowing.

### zalroews.pw

The PHP injected into `header.php` files uses PHP's `curl` library
to retrieve material from a host zalroews.pw.
`nptzow` and `nowir` also used hosts in ".pw" for the same purpose.

Hey, the IP address and the domain name match ISPs.
That's fresh and new.

`nptzow` and `nowir` used domains boriskq.pw and caforyn.pw
where this code uses zalroews.pw.
The registrars for boriskq.pw and caforyn.pw are different than
for zalroews.pw.
