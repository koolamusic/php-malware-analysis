# IndoXploit - hah.php

Seems like a very simple web shell, maybe with code borrowed
from [WSO](https://github.com/bediger4000/malware-phylogeny)

## Origin

Downloaded via a fake PHP [interactive spamming tool](http://stratigery.com/phparasites/823491.html)
that my WordPress honey pot captured years ago.  Either the original downloader of `823491.php`
gave away or sold the URL or bottom feeders look for "dorks" which indicate that search engines
have found some other bottom feeder's spamming tool out in the open.

The Internet Protocol address 139.195.26.25 is ultimately registered to:

	descr:          PT. First Media,Tbk
	descr:          Broadband Internet Service
	descr:          Citra Graha Building 4th Floor
	descr:          Jl. Gatot Subroto Kav 35-36
	descr:          Jakarta - Indonesia

Which makes sense. The code is generously commented with the phrase "IndoXploit",
and copyrighted by "http://indoxploit.or.id", which I don't think is valid.

## Another Instance

The original IndoXploit got downloaded on 2017-11-27.
I got a [second one](62.201.237.42-2018-04-30a) on 2018-04-28,
from a different IP address.
I got [yet another](197.48.152.236-2018-11-12a) variant on 2018-11-12.
This last variant claims to have done a lot of "manual coding, but
it appears that amounts to erasing all references to "IndoXploit".
