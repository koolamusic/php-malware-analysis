# Apache web server redirector

Creates a `.htaccess` file if the compromised host
is not blacklisted,
Undoes the work that the Vigilante Malware Detector did.

## Origin

### IP Address  98.172.253.136

Looks like a Cox Communications residential IP address.

    NetRange:       98.172.192.0 - 98.172.255.255
    CIDR:           98.172.192.0/18
    NetName:        NETBLK-HR-CBS-VOIP-98-172-192-0
    Customer:       Cox Communications (C01777751)
    RegDate:        2007-11-13
    Updated:        2007-11-13

`p0f3` says it runs Linux:

    [2018/08/01 05:26:27] mod=syn|cli=98.172.253.136/34838|srv=162.246.45.144/80|subj=cli|os=Linux 3.11 and newer|dist=11|params=none|raw_sig=4:53+11:0:1424:mss*20,7:mss,sok,ts,nop,ws:df,id+:0

### Download 

Apparently, the attacker thought they downloaded to a Web Shell by oRb ("WSO" or "FilesMan")
web shell.
The download was to URI `/blog/wp-content/themes/twentytwelve/404.php`,
a common place to stash web shells,
and it included HTTP parameters "pass", "action" and "p1".
The "action" parameter had the value "RC",
which would cause WSO to evaluate PHP code arriving in the "p1" parameter.
The "p1" parameter had PHP code with a base64-encoded string,
and a call to `eval()` builtin to execute the decoded string.

## Deobfuscation

The code putatively sent to WSO only had a single layer of base64 encoding.
Presumably this encoding just keeps simple pattern-matching IDS from triggering,
or maybe it just keeps web servers, PHP interpreters and WSO code from having problems with
unusual characters. Hard to say.

The [deobfuscated PHP source](dc2.php) has another base64 encoded string in it.

## Analysis

The deobfuscated code does two things:

1. Conditionally write out a `.htaccess` file, which would probably end up in
a directory `/blog/wp-content/themes/twentytwelve` under Apache's DocumentRoot
directory.
2. Rename all files where? that have a ".suspected" file name suffix to not have the ".suspected" suffix.

This last action is the most interesting.
There's a [Vigilante Malware Cleaner](https://github.com/bediger4000/php-malware-analysis/tree/master/198.71.239.41-2018-05-19a)
working compromised WordPress sites that renames suspicious files to have ".suspected" suffix.
The Vigilante code changes any file names that the Vigilantes deem to contain malware
to have a ".suspected" suffix.
The deobfuscated code undoes that change for files in its directory.

For every file name suffix it removes, the code writes out a line like this:

    404.php.suspected size 10562    404.php

The attacker would know which files got renamed,
and based on the size, what interest they might have.

### .htaccess file

The code checks for the compromised host's presence in two blacklists:
`dns.dbl.spamhaus.org`, and google.com safebrowsing.
If the compromised host name does not appear in either blacklist,
the code base64-decodes a string.

The base64-encoded string in the deobfuscates source would get written into a
file named `.htaccess`.
If this write works, it echoes the string "#####good#####", which would let
the attacker know that a `.htaccess` file is in place.

Only Apache httpd uses `.htaccess`, nginx and IIS do not.
The file itself is oddly formatted, with all lines having 30 leading tab characters,
and at least 30 trailing tab characters.
I guess is that the tab characters make a human looking at the `.htaccess` file
believe that it has no contents, and maybe ignore it.
Apache will read it correctly, it has visual camoflage to divert human readers.

This `.htaccess` makes Apache give a 403 HTTP code to
googlebot, bingbot and Baiduspider User Agent strings.
Apache would redirect any HTTP requests with a Referer in a list
of 33 very popular domain names to to http://yourstockexpert.su
with a 301 HTTP status code.

Strangely, yourstockexpert.su not known to dbl.spamhaus.org

yourstockexpert.su DNS name has an A record for 185.173.179.41.
One of the yourstockexpert.su DNS servers is also at that IP address.

yourstockexpert.su seems freshly registered by a Russian registrar:

    domain:        YOURSTOCKEXPERT.SU
    nserver:       ns1.yourstockexpert.su. 185.179.188.50
    nserver:       ns2.yourstockexpert.su. 185.173.179.41

185.173.179.41 seems to be owned by GalaxyStar, a Russian ISP:

Geolocators put 185.173.179.41 in downtown Yekaterinburg, Russia,
so the `whois` is consistent.
