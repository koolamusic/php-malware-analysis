# Jijle3 Web Shell - WSO 2.5 variant

A somewhat modified WSO 2.5 web shell.
Apparently modified by an Algerian hacker crew.
It claims to be "Jijle3 PHP Shell v 0.1.8".

* [2015-02-06](https://pastebin.com/8EEfu6gM) - different strain?
* [2016-09-01](https://pastebin.com/sDz4NX27)

I include the [2015-02-06](https://github.com/bediger4000/php-malware-analysis/tree/master/154.121.7.26-2018-08-07a/pastebin) version for comparison.
The author(s) do appear to have done some ongoing development.

### IP Address 154.121.7.26

`whois` has the IP address owned by Algerie Telecom Mobile:

    inetnum:        154.121.0.0 - 154.121.255.255
    netname:        MOBILIS-3G-NETWORK
    descr:          Algerie Telecom Mobile MOBILIS
    country:        DZ

This matches `geoiplookup` output.

### Download

Apparently, the attacker(s) believed they knew the URL of a WSO web shell
with the URI of "/wordpress//wp-content/plugins/wp-mobile-detector/cache/db.php".
The HTTP parameters include names "a", "c" and "p1" with values
stereotypical for WSO web shells.
The attacker(s) sent me this code as a "FilesMan" action, "uploadFile" subaction.
It would have ended up in a file named `2.php` if my WSO honey pot honored
FilesMan actions.

## Deobfuscation

The raw program starts out as a eval of a "\xNN"-encoded
PHP string:

    <?php
    //############################
    //Jijle3 Web PHP Shell 2015
    //dzph@bk.ru | FB.com/J1jeI
    //############################
    eval("\x65\x76\x61\x6C\x28\x67\x7...

Deobfuscation was pretty straightforward - about 8 layers of intermixed
PHP "\xNNN" encoding, base64-encoded gzips, and a final function:

    function dohavj05411($str) {
                $a = "\x62\x61\x73\x65\x36\x34\x5f\x64\x65\x63\x6f\x64\x65";
                $b = "\x67\x7a\x69\x6e\x66\x6c\x61\x74\x65";
                return $b($a($str));
    }

Which ends up like this, decoded:

    function dohavj05411($str)
    {
        $a = "base64_decode";
        $b = "gzinflate";
        return $b($a($str));
    }

Some automatic obfuscator must exist that does a specified number of encodings.
I've seen other PHP malware that uses the same multiple encodings.

I pretty-printed the [final version](f1.php) for readability.

## Analysis

The code could show an incredibly cool logo:

![martyr's crew logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bediger4000/php-malware-analysis/master/154.121.7.26-2018-08-07a/martyrs_crew_logo.png)

The code claims it was "Coded By Phenomene Dz Algeria - Jijel"

Google says: "Jijel is the capital of Jijel Province in north-eastern Algeria."
That aligns with the `whois` data, and a comment about the author, 

It is a WSO shell, claims to be WSO_VERSION 2.5.
Like all WSO variants, it decides what action to take based on the value of 
the HTTP parameter named "a".
It ends up dispatching to a function using PHP's `call_user_func()`.
The functions dispatched to all have names beginning with "action".
Jijle3 has all 13 "action" functions that WSO 2.5 has,
plus 32 more.
Most or all of these extra 32 functions are copied from other hacking tools.
Obvious examples include:

* `function actionlfiscan()` appears in other WSO variants, and on its own.
* The Perl code in `function actioncgi()` is from [priv8 bypass shell](https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/108693/Priv8-2012-Bypass-Shell.html) dated Jan 6, 2012
* `function actionftpsmtp()` seems to be lifted wholesale from 
either the "webroot" web shell, or wherever "webroot" got the code for
[wpindex.php](https://github.com/bediger4000/php-malware-analysis/blob/master/activex/webrot/wpindex.php).
* `function actionshellfind()` appears to constitute minor modifications
of a [PHP shell finder](https://pastebin.com/ymuirX1K) dated Oct 12, 2016

I feel like the additional code is mostly modified from the "webroot" 
web shell, but I can only find a few exact parallels between the webroot
I've got, and this code.

Jijle3 additional code is written in a different fashion than WSO variants.
The WSO author meticulously composed strings of HTML,
then used PHP's `echo` builtin to output.
Jijle3 author(s) include sections of HTML text separated from PHP
code by `<?`/`<?php` and `?>` tokens.
They used short open tags in some places,
which probably limits the code's ability to run everywhere.
A lot of the apparently borrowed code uses
older, deprecated functions like `ereg()`, and `mysql_query()`.
The borrowed code mostly assumes that it runs on Linux:
explicit use of `awk` occurs,
and unlike original WSO, it does distinguish between Windows and Linux
path separators.
