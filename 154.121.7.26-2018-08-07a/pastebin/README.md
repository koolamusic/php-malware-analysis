# Earliest pastebin occurance of Jijle3

File `8EEfu6gM` is the result of `wget https://pastebin.com/raw/8EEfu6gM`

## Deobfuscation

1. Pretty-print 8EEfu6gM into `f1.php`
2. Change "eval" to "print", invoke `php f1.php > dc1.php`
3. Pretty-print `dc1.php` into `f2.php` - the decoding function
uses a variable `$_X` defined in `f1.php`
4. Edit `f2.php` into `f1.php`.
5. Invoke `php f1.php > dc2.php`
6. Pretty-print `dc2.php` into `f3.php`

## Analysis

Now we can reasonably compare this pastebin occurance
with the one my honey pot caught
to see how the "Martyr's Crew" does software engineering.

This version: Jijle3 PHP Shell v 0.1

The one I caught: Jijle3 PHP Shell v 0.1.8

A number of HTML and spelling changes occurred between v0.1 and v0.1.8,
and a small amount of dead code got deleted.

It looks like not much changes, except appearance.
I think that's consistent with timid programmers who may not have a good
grasp of what their code base is intended to do.
Since the code base is filled with borrowed or copied code,
that makes a lot of sense.
