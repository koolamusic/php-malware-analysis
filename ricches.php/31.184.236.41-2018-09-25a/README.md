# Another cookie contents spamming tool

This is apparently an advanced version of the cookie-contents
spamming tool.

This document compares the two versions,
which my honey pot caught about 9 months apart.

## Origin

### IP Address 31.184.236.41

31.184.236.41 has DNS A record of omp-pronouns.outtimid.com.

omp-pronouns.outtimid.com does not have a reverse lookup.

outtimid.com does not have `whois` information,
and 31.184.236.41 has a bad internet reputation for spamming.

`whois` says that 31.184.236.41 is:

    inetnum:        31.184.236.0 - 31.184.236.255
    netname:        Makis_Systems_network
    country:        CZ

Oddly, one of the contacts is a Russian, in Moscow:

    person:         ALEXEY PANAFIDIN

That's amusing.
`geoiplookup` has the address in the Russian Federation.
Cross-border oddities are a trademark of IP addresses that behave poorly.


`p0f3` says Linux 3.1-3.10 for both this and the previous version.

### Download

The attackers used the same download technique both times.

Previous version sent to file name "ricches.php",
this one to "wbalyosian.php".

Both downloaded to what they attacker believed was a WSO webshell.
HTTP parameters specified a "FilesMan" action, "uploadFile" subaction,
and a WSO password of "nhzgrf" both times.

Both downloads were to very similar URLS:

* `/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/revslider/temp/update_extract/revslider/db.php`
* `/wordpress//wp-content/plugins/revslider/temp/update_extract/revslider/db.php`

That extra '/' in the 2nd URL has to be a bug in the attacker's tool.
They did use different host names, "www.stratigery.com" the first time,
"stratigery.com" the second time.

The used the same User Agent string: "Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1)"
both times, and if we believe `p0f3`, it's a lie.

## Analysis

This version is mostly a feature upgrade over the previous version.
It now seems to support "StartTLS" for SMTP.
The HTML it can generate for email bodys appears to be a bit more towards HTML5.
It composes SMTP headers a little differently than the previous version.
It also sets SOCKS proxy statuses a little differently. I'm not conversant with SOCKS,
so I have no idea why this change.
It looks like there might be a change around what status message(s) get sent back
to the spammer who invokes `wbalyosian.php`.
I deem this a bug fix, or at least an improvement.

Both versions use `<?` to introduce PHP,
which is now not the default for PHP interpreters ("short_open_tag" in `php.ini`).
This seems like an oversight,
as `<?php` will work even if short open tags are turned on.
The code will work on more compromised hosts if it has `<?php`.
