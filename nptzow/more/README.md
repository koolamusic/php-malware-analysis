I googled for ".php.suspected", and found a number of open DocumentRoot
directories, probably due to Vigilante Malware Cleaners or some
slightly stupid antivirus. Renaming compromised `index.php` files to
`index.php.suspected` leaves WordPress (or whatever) inoperable,
and Apache to come up with its own HTML for a "/" access.

I downloaded the .zip files from some of those open DocumentRoot directories.
