# Web Shell Program Installation Campaign

Record of a campaign to install Simple SOCKS5 Server for Perl
on a WordPress honey pot.

`geoiplookup` agrees, this IP address has a location somewhere in Germany.

### Download

The attacker tried to access a URI `/wp-content/themes/twentytwelve/data.php`
with HTTP POST parameters named "a", "c", "p1", "p2".
Given those parameter names, and the values taken on,
it's pretty clear that the attacker(s) believed they invoked a WSO web shell
at that URI.

## Analysis

The attacker(s) attempted to install a file named [sss.pl](files/91.109.19.24W1oV0qV8keuzatLIFymrwwAAAAc.0.file)
via a sequence of commands to a WSO (Web Shell by oRb) web shell.

Based on the fine-grained timestamp that PHP keeps as `$_SERVER['REQUEST_TIME_FLOAT']`,
I reconstructed the timeline of actions.
The table following lists values of "a", "c", "p1", "p2", "p3"
HTTP POST parameters (if present), in chronological order.

Using WSO 2.5 source code, and the values of HTTP parameters,
it's possible to reconstruct what commands the attacker(s) ran,
and recover some of their intent.

I don't see an attempt to access `sss.pl` at any later date.

I interpret this as an attempt to get a file `sss.pl` in some place in the
putatively compromised system running WordPress that is remotely accessible.
The attacker tries to upload a file using WSO's file editing capability,
which seems a little roundabout.
My WSO honey pot does not put a file name in its listing via the "edit",
so the attacker does not get any confirmation that the edited file exists.
This triggers an attempt to delete the file,
and then an upload of the file via HTTP file upload,
and WSO's interface to that.
My WSO honey pot does show "uploaded" file's names in FilesMan output,
so the attacker believes the file exists on the compromised WordPress host.
I guess that my WSO honey pot does not display the desired file permissions
that a real WSO would give an uploaded file,
so the attacker attempts to remedy this.
Incorrectly trying to set access times and file permissions has me
a little puzzled. Why bother? Is this an attempt to disguise the uploaded
`sss.pl` file visually?

The commands arrive less than a second apart,
which would seem to indicate that the attack was automated,
except maybe the very last command.
I don't think that 3.5 seconds is enough to have a browser render
HTML, scroll past irrelevant parts, and comprehend the output.

All accesses have a user agent string of "Opera/9.80 (Windows NT 6.1) Presto/2.12.388 Version/12.17"
Opera seems to support scripting through the "Tampermonkey" extension.
It's entirely possible that this is scripted through an Opera browser.

I have 46279 access with that user agent in my Apache logs,
from  2014-07-28 01:35:20-06 to 2018-07-05 06:53:49-06.
91.109.19.24 has access my web server 1635 times with that
user agent, so this is a small campaign in a larger stratigy of evil.
