# Syrian webmailer Installation Campaign

An all Web Shell by oRb (WSO) PHP file installation campaign.

First, they tried to install [m1.php](m1.php) a grotesquely obscured web mailer.
After an invocation of `m1.php` that my WSO honey pot wasn't smart enough to emulate,
the fooled around in my WSO honey pot, installed the Blacktools PHP Mailer,
tried to invoke it, and apparently became confused.

## Analysis

"nhzgrf" is a very commonly used WSO password.

Based on the intervals between HTTP requests, I'd have to say this was a human-driven campaign.
Beyond the inter-request intervals, only a human would repeatedly try to invoke the same URL,
upload a different, second mail tool, and walk up and down the directory tree.

My WSO honey pot does provide reasonably authentic file listings of a few directories
(`/var`, `/var/www`, `/var/www/html`), but it did not provide enough listings of well-known
WordPress directories.
The human driving this must have felt a lot of confusion.

## Unusual HTTP headers

All the HTTP requests made during this campaign had 3 extra HTTP headers.
They show up in my capture files like this:

    [HTTP_X_HOLA_UNBLOCKER_BEXT] => reqid 14798: before request, no pac, send headers, no pac 
    [HTTP_X_HOLA_REQUEST_ID] => 14798 
    [HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR] => 5.155.21.37 
    [HTTP_VIA] => 1.1 STC-J5K-11 (jaguar/3.0-11)

This appears to be related to using [Hola!VPN](https://hola.org/).
It didn't make much difference,
the HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR headers expose the IP address,
and actually don't seem to change it.

Hola!VPM also has a [bad](https://theprivacyblog.com/security-breaches/hola-vpn-service-security-train-wreck/) [reputation](https://thehackernews.com/2015/05/hola-widely-popular-free-vpn-service.html)

## m1.php

The initial download was for a file [m1.php](m1.php),
which turns out to be a heavily obscured web-enabled email tool.
My goodness, it had about 9 layers of gzipping-base64-encoding-repeat.

`m1.php` doesn't seem related to Blacktool PHP Mailer,
but my honey pot has caught it or variants before.

The [Rebels Mailer](../176.234.34.233-2018-04-13a) seems like it might be
a distant cousion of `m1.php`.
They share a lot of the same plain-text error messages.
